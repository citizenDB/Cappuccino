# Cappuccino - Save What Actually Matters
**Do you have hundreds of bookmarks but can't remember why you saved them?**

Cappuccino is different. It's not another bookmark folder destined to become digital clutter. It's your intentional reading list - a curated collection of articles, videos, and images you'll actually enjoy with your cappuccino.

## ðŸ’¡ The Problem We Solved

We've all been there: 47 browser tabs open, a bookmarks folder titled "Read Later" from 2019, and no idea what's actually worth your time. Traditional bookmarks are where content goes to be forgotten.
**Cappuccino changes that**. By creating a dedicated space for content you genuinely want to consume, you'll only save what's truly relevant to you right now.


## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Find something worth your time while browsing
2. Right-click on any page to save items to Cappuccino
3. Open your Cappuccino library during your next coffee break
4. Actually read, watch, and engage with content that matters
